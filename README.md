Players repeat a sequence of button presses and corresponding colors generated by the device, starting with a simple pattern. As players succeed, the game increases in complexity. Mistakes result in errors, restarting the sequence. This classic game is a test of memory and concentration, engaging players of all ages. Its simplicity and challenge have contributed to its enduring popularity, with various electronic and physical versions created over the years.
